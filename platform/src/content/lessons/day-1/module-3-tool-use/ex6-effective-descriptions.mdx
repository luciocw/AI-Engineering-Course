## What You'll Learn

- Why tool descriptions are your most important lever for tool use quality
- When to be verbose vs. concise in descriptions
- How to write parameter descriptions that reduce errors
- Using examples within descriptions to guide the LLM

## Key Concepts

### Why Descriptions Matter

The LLM reads your tool descriptions to decide:
1. **Whether** to use a tool at all
2. **Which** tool to pick when multiple could work
3. **What arguments** to pass

A poorly described tool is like a poorly labeled button -- the user (in this case, the LLM) will click the wrong one.

### Anatomy of a Good Tool Description

```typescript
// BAD: Too vague
{
  name: "search",
  description: "Searches stuff",
}

// BETTER: What it searches, when to use it
{
  name: "search_knowledge_base",
  description: "Search the internal knowledge base for company documentation, " +
    "policies, and procedures. Use this when the user asks about company-specific " +
    "information that wouldn't be in general knowledge. Returns matched documents " +
    "with titles and snippets.",
}

// BEST: Adds when NOT to use it
{
  name: "search_knowledge_base",
  description: "Search the internal knowledge base for company documentation, " +
    "policies, and procedures. Use this when the user asks about company-specific " +
    "information that wouldn't be in general knowledge. Returns matched documents " +
    "with titles and snippets. Do NOT use for general knowledge questions -- " +
    "only for company-internal information.",
}
```

### The Description Checklist

Every tool description should answer these questions:

| Question | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **What does it do?** | "Fetches the current stock price" |
| **When should it be used?** | "Use when the user asks about stock prices or market data" |
| **What does it return?** | "Returns price in USD, change %, and volume" |
| **When should it NOT be used?** | "Do not use for cryptocurrency -- use `get_crypto_price` instead" |

### Parameter Descriptions

Each parameter description should explain the format and give examples:

```typescript
{
  name: "search_orders",
  description: "Search customer orders by various criteria.",
  input_schema: {
    type: "object" as const,
    properties: {
      // BAD: No description
      customer_id: { type: "string" },

      // BETTER: Explains format
      customer_id: {
        type: "string",
        description: "The customer's unique ID in UUID format, e.g. '550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000'",
      },

      // BAD: Ambiguous
      date: { type: "string" },

      // BETTER: Specifies format and default behavior
      start_date: {
        type: "string",
        description: "Start date for the search range in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). " +
          "If omitted, defaults to 30 days ago.",
      },

      // BAD: Enum with no context
      status: {
        type: "string",
        enum: ["P", "S", "D", "C"],
      },

      // BETTER: Explains each option
      status: {
        type: "string",
        enum: ["pending", "shipped", "delivered", "cancelled"],
        description: "Filter by order status. 'pending' = not yet shipped, " +
          "'shipped' = in transit, 'delivered' = received by customer, " +
          "'cancelled' = order was cancelled.",
      },
    },
    required: ["customer_id"],
  },
}
```

### Verbose vs. Concise

**Be verbose when:**
- Tools have overlapping purposes (help the LLM distinguish)
- Parameters have specific formats (dates, IDs, codes)
- The tool has side effects (sends email, creates records)
- The domain is specialized (medical, legal, financial terms)

**Be concise when:**
- The tool name is self-explanatory (`get_current_time`)
- Parameters are obvious (`query` for a search tool)
- There is only one tool (no need to distinguish)

### Examples in Descriptions

Including examples in descriptions dramatically improves argument quality:

```typescript
{
  name: "query_database",
  description:
    "Execute a read-only SQL query against the analytics database. " +
    "The database contains tables: users, orders, products, reviews. " +
    "Example queries:\n" +
    "- 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE created_at > \\'2024-01-01\\''\n" +
    "- 'SELECT p.name, AVG(r.rating) FROM products p JOIN reviews r ON p.id = r.product_id GROUP BY p.name'\n" +
    "Only SELECT queries are allowed. No INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.",
  input_schema: {
    type: "object" as const,
    properties: {
      sql: {
        type: "string",
        description: "A valid SELECT SQL query. Use single quotes for string " +
          "literals. Tables available: users (id, name, email, created_at), " +
          "orders (id, user_id, total, status, created_at), " +
          "products (id, name, price, category), " +
          "reviews (id, product_id, user_id, rating, text).",
      },
    },
    required: ["sql"],
  },
}
```

### Testing Your Descriptions

A practical way to test descriptions is to try ambiguous prompts and see which tool gets selected:

```typescript
// If you have both search_web and search_knowledge_base,
// test with prompts that could go either way:
const testPrompts = [
  "What's our company vacation policy?",     // Should use knowledge_base
  "What are the best vacation spots?",        // Should use web
  "How much PTO do I have?",                  // Should use knowledge_base
  "What's the weather in Hawaii?",            // Should use web (or weather tool)
];
```

## Common Mistakes

1. **One-word descriptions** -- `description: "Search"` tells the LLM nothing. Always explain what, when, and what format.

2. **Contradicting the schema** -- If your description says "pass a list of IDs" but the schema defines a single string, the LLM gets confused. Keep them consistent.

3. **No negative guidance** -- Not saying when to avoid a tool leads to overuse. If you have `send_email`, specify "Only use when the user explicitly asks to send an email."

4. **Jargon without explanation** -- If a parameter uses domain-specific codes or formats, explain them. Don't assume the LLM knows your internal conventions.

5. **Forgetting the return value description** -- Telling the LLM what format the result comes back in helps it process and present the data to the user.

## Your Task

You have three poorly-described tools below. Rewrite their descriptions (tool-level and parameter-level) following the best practices from this lesson.

**Tool 1:** `search` -- searches products in an e-commerce catalog
**Tool 2:** `get_user` -- fetches user profile data from a CRM
**Tool 3:** `create_ticket` -- creates a support ticket in a helpdesk system

For each tool, write the full `Anthropic.Tool` definition with excellent descriptions. Then write three ambiguous test prompts and explain which tool should be selected for each.
